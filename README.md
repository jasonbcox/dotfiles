# Jason's dotfiles
------------------

## Setup

1. Copy files from .templates as necessary:
  a. .gituser - Change to your work email, for example.
  b. .profile_aliases - Any aliases or .bash_profile configs that you only want on this machine.

2. Create .gitligconfig and put any patterns that you want ignored from 'git lig'.  This file may be empty.
